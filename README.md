# Milk Quality and Environmental Impact Analysis

## Description
This repository contains the R source code and data necessary to reproduce the analysis conducted in the publication titled "Relationship between milk intrinsic quality scores and the environmental impact scores of dairy farms." The analysis aims to investigate the correlation between milk intrinsic quality scores and the environmental impact scores of dairy farms.

## Features
- Implementation of statistical analysis methods in R to assess the relationship between milk quality and environmental impact.
- Data preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the datasets for analysis.
- Statistical modeling scripts to perform the correlation analysis, including:
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
  - Correlation Analysis

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have R (version 4.1.2) installed on your system.
3. Install any required R packages, that are missing in your system, by running `install.packages("package_name")` in the R console.

## Usage
- Review the documentation provided within each R script to understand its functionality and usage.
- Run the appropriate R scripts for the analysis you wish to perform:
  - `PCA.R` for Principal Component Analysis
  - `ANOVA.R` for Analysis of Variance
  - `Correlation_Analysis.R` for Correlation Analysis
